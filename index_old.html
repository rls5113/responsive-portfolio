    Hello, my name is Robert Stuart.  I hope to share with you some basic information about me, at least enough for you to be familiar with me.  I consider myself easy going and very approachable.  I enjoy meeting new people and talking and sharing with others.  I am an only child and was adopted by my parents, Richard and Helen Stuart.  They were both a positive influence on my life; they remained together for my entire life.  I was born in Baltimore, Maryland and lived my first five years in Roanoke, Virginia.  I moved to Bowling Green, where I attended grade school, high school, and a year of college, at Western Ky University.  I worked in food service and serviced fax machines part time.  In 1986, I was offered, and accepted, a full time position to service fax machines in Nashville by a company called Telautograph Omnifax.  I met my wife, Jane, on the job when her company ordered a fax machine which I setup.  We have been married for 29 years.  We have two grown daughters, Lisa and Delores, one which is married and both are college graduates and currently live in Knoxville.

    After my first child, Lisa, was born, I decided that fax machines was not what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.  Longing for a new challenge, I enrolled in a Computer Science degree program at Nashville State Technical School. Personal computing was quite popular at the time, and soon found myself submersed in the pursuit of a marketable education.  Working during the day and going to school at night, it took five years to complete the curriculum and in 1999 earned an associates degree in Computer Science.  It was difficult and I would not have succeeded if not for the support of my family.

    My first programming job was when I accepted an internship with the State of Tennessee.  It was great fun and a respite from the daily driving and grind of servicing fax machines all over middle Tennessee and southern Kentucky!  Even though 
    I knew very little HTML, the department Office for Information Resouces (OIR) they put me in charge of their website very quickly.  They sent me to a few training classes, and before long was able to create and layout pages they were pleased with.  More later.
